# What is this about?

The idea of this project is to spread the signal which is Bitcoin. Many countries still lack bitcoin-only content and bitcoin-only communities, which is why are open-sourcing the concept that worked for us. 

We want to encourage you to *copy, remix,* and *modify this concept* to your needs.
