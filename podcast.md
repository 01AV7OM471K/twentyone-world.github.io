Create a beacon. Start a podcast. It has never been easier to start a podcast.
It is the perfect beacon because it is personal and easy to produce. 

Here are some formats that usually work well:
* Weekly news roundup, as championed with [RHR] by TFTC
* Interviews, as done by [Stephan Livera][SLP]
* Readings of books and articles, as championed by [Bitcoin Audible][BA]
* Answering the question, “How did you find your way to Bitcoin?”, as championed by “[Der Weg][DW]”

[RHR]: https://tftc.io/podcasts/
[SLP]: https://stephanlivera.com/ 
[BA]: https://bitcoinaudible.com/
[DW]: https://einundzwanzig.space/podcast/der-weg/

Start with one of these and do it in your native language. Weekly news roundups and reading translations is probably easiest. 

Episode frequency will depend on format and time commitment. Weekly or bi-weekly is good.
